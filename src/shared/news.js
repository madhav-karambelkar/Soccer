        description:'Chuni Goswami, the former first-class cricketer, passed away on Thursday (April 30), aged 82. The former Bengal all-rounder was suffering from long-term ailments related to sugar and prostrate, and passed away due to a cardiac arrest. \n Goswami played 46 first-class matches, picking up 47 wickets at 24.08 and scoring 1592 runs at 28.42. He also led Bengal in the 1971-72 Ranji Trophy final. However, his most notable exploits came while playing for a combined East and Central Zone team in December 1966, when he took eight wickets to defeat Garry Sobers West Indies - a team comprising of Clive Lloyd, Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Seymour Nurse and Rohan Kanhai among others. \n His move to cricket took place in 1964 after finishing a decorated career in football, at the age of 27. Goswami, by then, had represented India in 50 international games. He even led the country to a Gold medal finish at the 1962 Asian Games.'

        description:'The inaugural season of The Hundred, the ECB`s new eight-team men tournaments which were set to begin this summer, has been postponed until 2021 in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the ECB confirmed on Thursday (April 30).\n The decision is not unexpected. The ECB, who announced last week that there will be no professional cricket in England and Wales until at least July 1, have previously stated that their priorities for when cricket resumes are international cricket and the Vitality T20 Blast. Given the narrowing window available, The Hundred was always going to be tough to squeeze in.\n An ECB Board meeting was held on Wednesday to specifically discuss the future of the new tournaments and it was there that the decision to delay the launch was made. The option of scrapping the competitions completely was ruled out and the ECB will press ahead with launching both the men versions of The Hundred in 2021.'

        description:'The Bangladesh Cricket Board revealed that it is yet to completely rule out touring Sri Lanka in July, stating that discussions between the two boards were ongoing about potentially playing the series. The board, however, insisted that government instruction will be taken into account before making a final commitment with regards to the series. \n BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury confirmed to Cricbuzz that both boards were having regular meetings regarding the future of the three-Test series. "Even yesterday I had a meeting with SLC chief executive and we are discussing about the tour but we are yet to decide anything at the moment," said Nizamuddin.\n Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, Bangladesh postponed their tour of Pakistan in March for an ODI and a Test in Karachi in March. As the condition around the world worsened, they postponed their white-ball tour of Ireland in May. Bangladesh two-Tests series against Australia was also been postponed with severe doubt over the other big home Test series, against New Zealand in August.'
