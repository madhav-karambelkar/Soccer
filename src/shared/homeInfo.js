        description: 'Often simply called the “World Cup”, this is the largest international soccer tournament in the world. Hosted by the Fèdèration Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA, it draws in more viewers than the entire Olympic Games. \n Inspired by the success of soccer at the Olympic Games, FIFA began its attempt to organize an international soccer tournament of its own in 1904. It took until 1930 before they pulled it off, hosting the first World Cup in Uruguay, with the home team as the first champions. Since then, excluding the years when World War II prevented the championship, the World Cup has been played every four years, rising above its early obstacles of intercontinental conflict to become the world’s premier football event. \n But these intercontinental conflicts aren’t just limited to war. Travel concerns between teams were also a huge concern. For example, early on many South American teams didn’t want to travel all the way to Europe. Concerns about international travel costs persist to present day, especially considering the already-expensive tickets to the game itself.'

        description:'Soccer was first introduced in the Olympic games in 1908 as an official competition, with women’s soccer being introduced in 1928. In the early years, soccer in the Olympics was only played by amateurs and was more for show than an actual serious competition. But the rising popularity of the sport raised the stakes. To this day, it is one of the most popular, viewed, and followed sport competitions in the Summer Olympics, and the second most in the sport itself. \n Like planning to attend the World Cup, planning to attend the Olympics takes a lot of time. Tickets should be purchased at least a year in advance, and they will be expensive, so make sure to save up if you definitely want to go. And depending on travel conditions between your home country and the host country, getting there will take some planning as well. Unlike the FIFA Games, the Olympics only last seventeen days, making attending these events less of a time commitment. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t plan ahead — the events are often sprawled out in time and location, so you need to schedule your time carefully.'

        description:'Simply called “The Euros”, the UEFA European Championship is the primary football competition between the senior men’s national teams of the UEFA’s member countries. Originally called the UEFA European Nations Cup, this championship determines the continental champion of Europe. It is held every four even-numbered years, from the second week of June to the second week of July, between the World Cup tournaments so as not to cause any overlap or conflict. The European Championship can be co-hosted by two neighboring qualified European countries. The championship winners have the added bonus of earning the opportunity to compete in the FIFA Confederations Cup. \n The Championship was founded in 1960 and has been played every four years ever since. The idea of a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by Henri Delaunay, the French Football Federation’s secretary-general, in 1927 but wasn’t made official until 1958, three years after Delaunay’s death, leading the trophy to be named after him and the game’s first hosting country to be France in his honor. Over the next fifty years the qualified teams would expand from eight to twenty-four. The current champions are Spain, who won in 2012, and the next championship is to be held this year from June 10th to July 10th, 2016, in France. \n Since the UEFA European Championship runs every four years, it is difficult to get tickets and transportation. Tickets must be purchased a year in advance and travel arrangements planned and made as soon as the next hosting country is announced, which is typically every three years or the year following the latest championship game.'

        description:'The Copa Libertadores de America is an annual international club football competition in South America. It is one of the most prestigious football club competitions in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football. It includes thirty-eight teams from eleven associations from around the world. It is hosted every year in a different Latin American country, with rounds happening for the majority of the yearlong season and the final championship happening sometime in the middle of May. The winning team of the Copa Libertadores is qualified to play in the FIFA World Cup championship. \n Named after the Libertadores, the main leaders of the South American wars for independence, the cup was founded in 1960. Since it is such a prestigious event, tickets are incredibly hard to come by, as they are expensive and sell quickly, but games happen on an annual rather than a quarter-annual basis, making the chances of attending at least one game more likely and giving you plenty of chances to go or plan in advance. It is easier to go if you live in Latin America but since it is an international tournament, it is possible to make travel arrangements in advance of the final championship from wherever you live.'
